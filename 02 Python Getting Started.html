    <h3>Python Install</h3>
    <p>Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</p>
    <br>
    <p>To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following on
        the Command Line (cmd.exe):</p>
    <strong>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</strong>
    <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open the
        Terminal and type:</p>
    <strong>python --version</strong>
    <p>If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from the
        following website: <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank">Click to go on Python</a></p>
    <h3>Python Quickstart</h3>
    <p>Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a
        text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.</p>
    <p>The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:</p>
    <strong>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</strong>
    <p>Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.</p>
    <p> Let's write our first Python file, called helloworld.py, which can be done in any text editor.</p>
    <ul>
        <strong>helloworld.py</strong>
        <li>print("Hello, World!")</li>
        <p>Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file,
            and run:</p>
        <strong>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</strong><br>
        The output should read: <strong>Hello, World!</strong>
        <strong>Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.</strong>
    </ul>
    <h3>The Python Command Line</h3>
    To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This
    is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.

    Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:
